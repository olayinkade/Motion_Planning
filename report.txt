IMPLEMENTATION OF RRT:
This is the implementation of a standard single source RRT algorithm, where for every new node generated, an appropriate
node will be added to the nearest node and the new node becomes the nearest node's child.
The length of the connection between the tree and the new generated point is limited by a growth factor. Every time a
new point is generated, the path between it and the nearest node in the tree will be checked to see if it passes through
any obstacles on the map. If the answer is yes, then another check will be performed to see with a max step of 5, can we
place any other point on that path to add it to the tree at the nearest node. If the asnwer is still no, a different
random point will be generated.
